#Objective : Improve Efficiency of Stock Analysis

Our client, Steve, loves the workbook prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although the code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.

In order to all Steve to scale his reasearch up to a larger selection of stocks, the objective is to refactor the code.  *Refactoring* is a coding process of streamlining process in code in order to improve efficiency.  In order to test if efficiency has been improved, we will evaluate the time it takes for calculations to run to completion.  We will compare the rates from the original code and the refactored code. 

The original calculations were conducted using nested loops and checking for ticker symbols in each row.  This process was successful and screenshots were captured to document the time to completion of the analysis.
